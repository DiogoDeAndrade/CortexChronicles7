# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 7 - TBD

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is Trains

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

This time, I'm using [GameMaker]. I've used in the the past, many years ago, but it sure looks like it has changed a lot!
I'm going to use code, since I prefer to program than using visual tools.

## Game

TBD, but it has trains!
