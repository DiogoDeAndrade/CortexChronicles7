# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 7 - The Heist of Jax Riven

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme is Trains

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

This time, I'm using [GameMaker]. I've used in the the past, many years ago, but it sure looks like it has changed a lot!
I'm going to use code, since I prefer to program than using visual tools.

## Game

In this game, you play as Jax Riven, a former D-Boy turned freedom fighter. In the previous game, our heroes infiltrated the research lab of Doctor Cogwell and exposed
some weaknesses on the Prime Nexus. Now, they need a tactical nuclear warhead for their plans, and will have to use an armored hovertrain to steal it!
